I am just trying to learn reinforcement learning

THe initial state is at a random position from limx->0+ to limx->10-

My state includes the car's position from the left wall and the angle of movement
THe action is to change the car's angle 

THe linear model's output is the mean and log(std) from which I sample from

The end is after 100 sucessful steps
